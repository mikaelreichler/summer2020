Matlab-ohjeet:
-----------------

Open file Grab_Matlab.m with MatLab

Set variables in the beginning of the document: 

File directory and name (fileDirectory)
Number of frames in the recording (framecount), large framecounts takes pretty long to process and write to disk
Framerate (framerate), can be set between 30 and 230 Hz, 
Exposure time of individual frames in microseconds (exposure), minimum is 5 and maximum depends on framerate. Check out ExposureTimes.png (in the current folder)

To run/record, press F5

The frame acquasition starts after about 6 seconds, and matlab prints 'starting acquisition'.
